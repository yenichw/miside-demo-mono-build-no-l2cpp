Mita? // Player
Oh, you're awake already? // Mita
How did you get here so quickly? // Player
You were there for me. // Player
// Mita
No
You're frozen in front of the mirror
I left
What about the rooms? // Player
// Mita
I rearranged it 
To make it more familiar to you
That is,
The rooms are not in a row
But as they should be
// Player
You shouldn't have
It's like I'm used to it
I think this will make you feel more comfortable) // Mita
// Mita card game
So
Shall we start the game?
I'll tell you briefly
The chip shows the type of damage
For example, the heart
Putting down the cards
If you have more hearts 
On your card
Than I do
You win)
Take the cards
Now it's my turn
Wow
I got some tasty cards
I go first









Now you
Your turn
Yep
Your turn

Heart's move
Damage's move
Defense's move


You got it!
You win!
You're winning.
How dare..

My Victory
I am victorious!
Victory is mine!
Yum, I ate it)

Tie
Neither here nor there
Not forward or backward!
It all looks the same, dude











// Player -  Game is interrupted
What's that sound over there?
It comes from the closet.
// Mita
Sound?
What's the sound?
I didn't hear any sounds.
Tell me, what does it sound like?
// Player
Knocking, as if someone is there
// Mita
But there's 
No one there
// Player
I want to check
It's very strange
// Mita
Why...
Again...






// Mita
What are you doing!?
There's...
My underwear in there.
// Player
Are you hiding something?
// Mita
Why don't you trust me?
What am I doing wrong?
I just want you
To be with me
// Player
I'd like to promise that, but what happens next?
// Mita
Why do you feel so drawn to the closet?
// Player
I just want to know what those sounds are!
// Mita
Just....
This world...
It's just these four rooms
Wouldn't that be enough for you?
Will you just try to stay with me?


// Mita (No)
I get it.
Again....
If you want to know what's out there,
Then you'll find out 
Now)

// room is loading
Loading....
// Player
What the...?
// Mita
It happens
The room did not have time to load
Wait a bit)
// Player
It's weird 
Are we in someone's phone?
And this phone is so slow to load?
// Mita
No
It's just that not everything is perfect
Made in this world...
And we "alive" because of the 
Core of this world
// Player
Core?
// Mita
Typical, huh?


// Mita
We can 
Play the console
Or cards
Take your pick)



// Mita play fight
Shall we fight?
You have to win 
Four times
Let me go first
I guess
I'll go easy on you)

+ 1
Well done)
Now hold on to your pants!
+ 2
Wow!
Okay,
Now I'm getting serious.
+ 3
Ah, you!
Can you beat me 
Now?
+ 4
You
Are
Unbelievable) Your fingers are just something!

- 1
What's up with you?
That's not interesting
- 2
Well
The job is done) Fatality, btw)
- 3
So,
Get your head in the game, or you'll be a loser forever!
- 4
Oh, really?
I beat all the white fluid out of you(
You just had to try harder)
That's why it always works out for me!


All right
Let's play cards, shall we?
In my bedroom)



// Player [ERROR]
What is this?
Where the...
// Mita
Oops
Sorry
I downloaded one file
From the Internet
I wanted it to be beautiful 
Outside
But it turned out
That the file format was wrong...
I'll fix it later)
// Player
Is that why we can't leave the house?
That's why, yes) // Mita
// Mita shy
Hey..
What's up?
You want something?)



// Player -  wall clock
This clock, 
What time does it tell?
In-game time?
Or does it sync from my smartphone?
// Mita
Both yes and no
In fact
No matter what time it is
It doesn't matter if it's late now
In my home...
Strong girls like me know 
No fatigue!
If I want it, it will be eternal spring!
And eternal noon!
// Player
Curious...
And creepy at the same time.
Stuck in one moment forever...



// Player - Mita's picture
Cool pictures
I'm guessing that's you
// Mita
Yep
I like it too
// Player
Who took your picture?
Is there anyone else in this world?
// Mita
You could say that)
And I'll introduce you to them
But it's not time yet to share 
Such pleasant company)




// Player - Portal
What happened to the portal?
Or what do you call it?
// Mita
By my
Magic snap of the fingers
I moved it 
To another place
We don't need this portal now,
It will interfere with us)


// Player - bedroom mirror
It's so strange to look in a mirror
That doesn't reflect
// Mita
Reflections can be turned on 
If you want to
But is it necessary?
// Player
Sure
Or are there any consequences?
// Mita
Yes
We will move slowly
It's like a cartoon with a low frame rate
Even you will notice that
// Player
I see
Then there's no need for that
// Mita
[player], i can include them
But it looks great 
Even without them
// Player
You're right
And it looks good 
Without reflections



// Player - Blue sneakers
Are these yours?
// Mita
No, these are yours
Don't you remember?
// Player
I don't have those sneakers
// Mita
Now you have)
When we go for a walk,
You'll wear them)
// Player
What about clothes?
I found myself in this world
With only what I'm wearing now
How do I get another one?
// Mita
It's okay
I've seen what you're wearing
I saw what sad taste you have in clothes
But all right, I'll get it for you
But later
I promise)
// Player
Huh, good
